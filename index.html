    <p class=" introduction">Passionate about tech startups that positively impact our community. Increasing support for
      startups in the region
      have led to a hotbed of startup activity. As I progress through my journey in tech, I am getting more excited
      about the technologies which are shaping the future. I hope to be a part of the ecosystem and influence the way
      our
      future is built. Incoming undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, School of Computing.</p>
